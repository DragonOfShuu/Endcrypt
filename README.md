# Endcrypt
 A repository for a project I constructed in 2021. Make your own cool "encryption"!

# Explanation

Endcrypt
-
Input the text, and you can press execute, and get a scrambled output! You can also set a key, which uses the Caesar Cipher to further confuse anybody trying to decrypt!

If you press the button that says `Encrypt Mode`, you can change it to decrypt, which decrypts the message entered! *Please note that a key may be necessary to decrypt the message. Without it, it will give you jumbled characters if a key was given upon encryption.*

Bruteforce
-
This is a rewritten version of the encryption, which bruteforces a decrypt. It will give you every possible combinatin that the message could be.

Simply enter the message, and press `Execute`. You will now be given every single possible response that the message could be. And yes, there are only 26 possible combinations ;)
